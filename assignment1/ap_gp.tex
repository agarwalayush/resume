\section*{Arithematic Progression}
\subsection*{Defination}
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. 
For instance, the sequence $5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 â€¦ $is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.\\

\subsection*{Calculation}
If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is $a_1$ and the common difference of successive members is d
, then the nth term of the sequence ($a_n$) is given by:\\
\vspace{2mm}
 $$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d,$$\\
 or, in general
 $$a_n = a_m + (n - m)d,$$\\
To drive the formula for sum of n terms($S_n$) of an A.P..\\
Let \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_n&=& a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + ..... (a + (n - 1)d)\\
S_n&=&(a_n - (n - 1)d) + (a_n - (n - 2)d) + ..... + a_n - d + a_n\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\textrm Adding Both sides of the equation, we get\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
2S_n&=& n(a + a_n)\\
2S_n&=& n(a + a + (n - 1)d) \\
2S_n&=& n(2a + (n - 1)d) \\
S_n&=& \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n - 1)d) \\
\end{eqnarray*}
